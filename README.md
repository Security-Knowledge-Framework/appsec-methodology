# Whitebox Security Assessment Methodology

Welcome to the repository for our Whitebox Security Assessment Methodology. This document serves as an in-depth guide designed specifically for security champions and application security (AppSec) engineers. The goal is to provide a structured approach to conducting whitebox security assessments of applications within your organization. This methodology outlines all necessary steps to achieve the most effective security testing results, ensuring thorough examination and improvement of your application's security posture.

## Overview

This repository houses a methodology document that guides you from the initial setup to the detailed execution of a whitebox security assessment. It assumes that you have already completed the preliminary steps of obtaining multiple user accounts with varying privileges. This is essential for testing for IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References) and authorization bypasses, and ensures you have full access to the application's codebase and operational documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into the detailed testing methodology, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- **Multiple User Accounts:** You should have access to user accounts at different privilege levels to effectively test the application’s authorization mechanisms.
- **Code Access:** Full access to the application’s source code is crucial for an in-depth review and assessment.
- **Operational Documentation:** Having operational documentation at hand helps understand the intended functionality and architecture, which is vital for effective testing.

## Target Audience

This document is crafted for:
- **Security Champions**: To help embed robust security practices within the development lifecycle.
- **AppSec Engineers**: To enhance expertise in security testing and vulnerability management.
