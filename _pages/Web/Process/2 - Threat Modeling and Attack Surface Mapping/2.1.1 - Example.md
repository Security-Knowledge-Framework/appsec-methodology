### **List All Application Components**

From the Dockerfile we can learn that in this scenario it is a fairly straightforward `nodeJS` application with a `mysql` database
```bash
FROM node:alpine

# Install packages
RUN echo 'http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.6/main' >> /etc/apk/repositories
RUN echo 'http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.6/community' >> /etc/apk/repositories
RUN apk add --update --no-cache supervisor mariadb mariadb-client curl

# Setup app
RUN mkdir -p /app

# Add application
WORKDIR /app
COPY challenge .

# Install dependencies
RUN yarn

# Setup superivsord
COPY config/supervisord.conf /etc/supervisord.conf

# Expose the port node-js is reachable on
EXPOSE 1337

# Populate database and start supervisord
COPY --chown=root entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

### **Visualize Data Flow**

This is just simply clicking trough the application and get a good idea how it behaves and where data is being reflected etc. Examples could be:
- whenever we fill in a form does the output get reflected into a Administration panel that we can initially not see with our low level user. 
- Does data that we input get used in iie a file name?
- Does data that we input get used in an XML form?
- Does data that we input get send to 3rd party applications?
So, how does the application behave and how does user supplied input move trough the application

### **Map External Interactions and Dependencies**

In this example we will find that the application downloads packages from the CDN of `http://dl-cfn.alpinelinux.org` and `apk`. Since they don't use their own registry it might me interesting to verify type-squatting level mistakes in the `package` files to verify if we can distribute malware via supply chain attacks.

### **Identify Security Controls**

We  found that authentication/authorization decisions are being made by means of `JWT`
-> `"jsonwebtoken": "^8.5.1",`
->`/web_spiky_tamagotchi/challenge/middleware/AuthMiddleware.js`

For now let's make note of this finding in our RTM so we can investigate it later.

| Feature ID | Description         | potential Vulnerability            | Test Method                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F001       | User Authentication | JWT is prone to signature bypasses | SCA should point out CVE. There is also other methods of attack that need to be tested described here:<br>https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt |
